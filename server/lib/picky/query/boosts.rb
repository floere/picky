    # Calculates boosts for combinations.
    #
    # Example:
    #   Someone searches for peter fish.
    #   Picky might match this to categories as follows:
    #     [:name, :food]
    #   and
    #     [:name, :surname]
    #
    # This class is concerned with calculating boosts
    # for the category combinations.
    #
    # Implement either
    #   #boost_for(combinations)
    # or
    #   #boost_for_categories(category_names) # Subclass this class for this.
    #
    # And return a boost (float).
    #

      # Example:
      #   [:name, :height, :color] returns +3, but
      #   [:name, :height, :street] returns -1.
      #
      # Note: Use Array#clustered_uniq to make
      #       [:a, :a, :b, :a] => [:a, :b, :a]

      #
      # Note: Cache this if more complicated weighings become necessary.
