    # Returns the topmost n results.
    # (Note that not all ids are returned with the results. By default only maximally 20.)
    #
    # === Parameters
    # * limit: The amount of ids to return. Default is all of them.
    #
    def ids limit = nil
      ids = []
      allocations.each { |allocation| allocation[4].each { |id| break if limit && ids.size > limit; ids << id } }

    # Populates the ids with (rendered) model instances.
    #
    # Give it an AR class and options for the find and it
    # will yield each found result for you to render.
    #
    # If you don't pass it a block, it will just use the AR results.
    #
    # Note: Usually, after this the ids are not needed anymore.
    #       Use #clear_ids to remove them.
    #
    # === Parameters
    # * model_class: The model to use for the results. Will call #find on the given class.
    #
    # === Options
    # * up_to: Amount of results to populate. All of them by default.
    # * finder_method: Specify which AR finder method you want to load the model with. Default is #find (which raises ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound if items are in the index but no longer in your database. Use :find_by_id if you want it to be more forgiving.
    # * The rest of the options are directly passed through to the ModelClass.find(ids, options) method. Default is {}.

    # * the model instances, if you have used #populate_with _without_ a block
