h2. Version 1.2.4 (unreleased)

 * hanke: (server) default_indexing provides a new option @reject_token_if => some_lambda@, e.g.: @reject_token_if: lambda { |token| token.nil? || token == :hello }@ where you can define which tokens go into the index, and which do not. Default lambda is: &:empty?. This means that only non-empty tokens are saved in the index. You could, for example, not save tokens that have length < 2. Note that tokens are symbols.
 * hanke: (statistics) Fixed a bug where the last line in the log file was counted once a second time after reloading the stats.

h2. Version 1.2.3

 * hanke: (server) Fixed a bug where the partial strategy @Partial::None@ was not correctly used: A query like @Peter@ did not return results even if "Peter" could be found using quotes: "Peter" (FYI, double quotes force Picky to use the exact index instead of the partial one. While, conversely, the asterisk * forces Picky to use the partial index instead of the exact one).

h2. Version 1.2.2

 * hanke: (statistics) Statistics server handles logfile reading in a cleaner way when the gem has been installed by root.

h2. Version 1.2.1

 * hanke: (statistics) (BETA) New statistics gem for Picky. Run @picky stats path/to/your/search.log [port]@ to start a statistics server. Go to "http://localhost:4567":http://localhost:4567 after running the command to take a look.

h2. Version 1.2.0

 * hanke: (client) (BREAKING) Picky::Client::Base.search(:query => 'bla') has changed to Picky::Client::Base.search('bla'), as the query itself is not optional. The rest of the options is still passed in as a Hash through the second parameter.

h2. Version 1.1.7 (1.2.0 pre)

 * hanke: (server) Redefined API for 1.1.6 beta feature, ranged search.
 * hanke: (documentation) API for #define_ranged_category.

h2. Version 1.1.6

 * hanke: (server) Enabled beta feature "low/high limited range search", see "API RDoc":http://floere.github.com/picky/doc/index.html (IndexAPI class).

h2. Version 1.1.5

 * hanke: (server) Passing in a similarity search (e.g. with text "hello") will never return "hello" as a similar token.

h2. Version 1.1.4

 * hanke: (generators) Removed unnecessary jquery-1.3.2 from client, since it wasn't referenced anyway.

h2. Version 1.1.3

  * hanke: (server) The CouchDB source now uses a little trick/hack to make its ids work in Picky. They are translated into decimal numbers from its hex string representations. Recalculate using #to_s(16) before getting objects from CouchDB in a webapp.

h2. Version 1.1.2

 * hanke: (generators) Added generator for empty unicorn projects, use @picky generate empty_unicorn_project <project_name>@ to generate one.

 * hanke: (server) New :from option. Assume you have a source @Sources::CSV.new(:title, file:'some_file.csv')@ but you want the category to be called differently. Use the from option as follows: @define_category(:similar_title, :from => :title)@.
 * hanke: (server) CSV source uses @FasterCSV@, passing through all its options (@col_sep@, @row_sep@ et cetera).
 * hanke: (server) More understandable output for rake try, rake try:index, rake try:query.

h2. Version 0.12.1 (1.0.0 pre2)
