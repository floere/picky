h1. Picky

h2. The combinatorial small-text search engine.

Take a dive with Picky in "the Getting Started section":http://floere.github.com/picky.
Fine everything else in "the Picky Wiki":http://github.com/floere/picky/wiki.

h1. Installation

Note that Picky only runs on Ruby 1.9. I recommend "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ for installing and managing Ruby versions.

<pre><code>gem install picky picky-client</code></pre>

h2. The server

The server generates a library example, which you can run right away.

<pre><code># Generates a directory "app_name"
# with a new Picky project.

picky project app_name</code></pre>

<pre><code>cd app_name
bundle install</code></pre>

h3. Index the data

<pre><code>rake index</code></pre>

h3. Start the Picky server

<pre><code>rake start</code></pre>

h3. Try a query!

<pre><code>curl localhost:8080/books/full?query=test</code></pre>

Don't worry about the strange looking results! The next part (client) will take care of them.

If you're interested anyway: "Results (Format & Structure)":http://github.com/floere/picky/wiki/results-format-and-structure

h2. The client

The client generates an example app for the "library" example backend, using Sinatra.

<pre><code># Generates a directory "app_name"
# with a new Picky Client Webapp project.

picky-client sinatra app_name</code></pre>

<pre><code>cd app_name
bundle install</code></pre>

h3. Start the app server

<pre><code>unicorn -p 3000</code></pre>

h3. Admire your work

Go to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/ and try the examples.

h2. Your own search

You're probably itching to change the example for your own data. How do you do this?

h3. The server

In the server directory, just type

<pre><code>rake</code></pre>

and it will tell you where to change the server configuration.

h3. The client

Go to "http://localhost:3000/configure":http://localhost:3000/configure and the page will show you how to configure your app server.

h2. Need help?

Right here. I'm happy to help! If something doesn't work, send/gist me your application.rb and I'll look into it.
