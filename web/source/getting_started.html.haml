    %h3 You go here
    %p This takes about 5 minutes. After that, you'll have a running Picky server and a web frontend to play with.
    %h3 Overview
    %p Before we start, the big picture:
    %img{ :src => 'diagrams/basic-overview.png', :width => '480px' }
    %p
      That's the basic setup. The things to remember are:
      %ol
        %li The Picky server calculates IDs for a query.
        %li Your app server renders results for the resulting IDs.
        %li The Picky JS frontend offers help to the user.
    %p
      Together they are like a small A-Team, something like "Action Search Squad Alpha"! «We've got the results and are heading back to base now, Sir!» Bam!
    %p
      Note that you don't need a Picky client. You could just as well use the results in your Python/Java/PHP app server (If you happen to write a client for one of these, please let me know).
    %h3 System Requirements
    %p
      %ul
        %li OSX / Linux
        %li
          %a{ :href => 'http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/' } Ruby 1.9
        %li
          %a{ :href => 'http://gembundler.com/' } Bundler Gem
    %p
      I recommend
      %a{ :href => 'http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/' } RVM
      for installing and managing Ruby versions.
    %h3 Installation
    %code
      %pre
        gem install picky-generators
    %p
      This will also install the needed gems "picky" and "picky-client".
    %h3 The server
    %p The server generates a library example, which you can run right away.
    %code
      %pre
        :preserve
          # Generates a directory "app_name"
          # with a new Picky default server project.
          # Type "picky generate" to see other options.

          picky generate server app_name
      %pre
        :preserve
          cd app_name
          bundle install
    %h4 1. Index the data
    %code
      %pre
        rake index
    %h4 2. Start the server
    %code
      %pre
        rake start
    %h4 3. Try a query
    %code
      %pre
        curl localhost:8080/books?query=test
    %p
      Don't worry about the strange looking results!
      The next part (client) will take care of them.
    %p
      If you're interested anyway:
      %a{ :href => 'http://github.com/floere/picky/wiki/results-format-and-structure' } Results (Format & Structure)
    %h3 The client
    %p The client generates an example app for the "library" example backend, using Sinatra.
    %code
      %pre
        :preserve
          # Generates a directory "app_name"
          # with a new Picky client Sinatra project.

          picky generate client app_name
    %pre
      :preserve
        cd app_name
        bundle install
    %h4 1. Start the app server
    %code
      %pre
        unicorn -p 3000
    %h4 2. Admire your work
    %p
      Go to
      %a{ :href => 'http://localhost:3000/' } http://localhost:3000/
      and try the examples.
    %h3 Your own search
    %p
      You're probably itching to change the example for
      your own data. How do you do this?
    %h4 The server
    %p In the server directory, just type
    %code
      %pre
        rake todo
    %p and it will tell you where to change the server configuration.
    %h4 The client
    %p
      Go to
      %a{ :href => 'http://localhost:3000/configure' } http://localhost:3000/configure
      and the page will show you how to configure your app server.
    %p
      That's it, congratulations! :)

    %h3 Need assistance?
    %p
      Right here. I'm happy to help!
      If something doesn't work, send/gist me your app/application.rb
      and I'll look into it.

      %a{ :href => 'mailto:florian.hanke@gmail.com' } mail (gmail)
    %p
      There's a Wiki as well:

    %h3 Accompanying Video
    %p
      If you don't have the time or leisure to do it yourself, watch this:
    %iframe{ :src => "http://player.vimeo.com/video/17161012", :width => "460", :height => "365", :frameborder => "0" }
    %p
      Note that the video was made with version 1.0.0.
    %p
      In the latest version, instead of
    %code
      %pre
        :preserve
          picky project &lt;server dir&gt;
          picky-client sinatra &lt;client dir&gt;
    %p
      the following commands are now used:
    %code
      %pre
        :preserve
          picky generate unicorn_server &lt;server dir&gt;
          picky generate sinatra_client &lt;client dir&gt;
    %p
      A bit more wordy, but hopefully clearer what it does.
